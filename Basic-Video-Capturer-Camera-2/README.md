# Basic Video Capturer Camera 2

Sample app shows how to use the custom capturer using the [Camera2](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary) package. This class was introduced in API level 21 by providing an alternative for deprecated [Camera](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera) class.

> Note: If you want to support API level below 21 [Basic Video Capturer](../Basic-Video-Capturer) project contains capturer for deprecated [Camera](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera) class.

> Note: Check [Custom Video Driver](../Custom-Video-Driver) project to see how custom video capturer and custom video renderer works together.

A custom video capturer will be helpful when:
- streaming any content other than the one coming from the device camera, e.g. streaming content of a particular view's game or content.
- modifying the camera stream content - image composition (adding watermark logo) or image processing (removing the background or putting a virtual hat on the user).

## Using a custom video capturer

After instantiating a Publisher object, the code sets a custom video capturer by calling the
`capturer()` method of the `Publisher`:

```java
publisher = new Publisher.Builder(MainActivity.this)
    .capturer(new MirrorVideoCapturer(MainActivity.this))
    .build();
```

The `MirrorVideoCapturer` class extends the `BaseVideoCapturer` class, defined in the OpenTok Android SDK. The `getCaptureSettings()` method returns the settings of the video capturer, including the frame rate, width, height, video delay, and video format for the capturer:

```java
@Override
public synchronized CaptureSettings getCaptureSettings() {
    CaptureSettings settings = new CaptureSettings();
    settings.fps = desiredFps;
    settings.width = (null != cameraFrame) ? cameraFrame.getWidth() : 0;
    settings.height = (null != cameraFrame) ? cameraFrame.getHeight() : 0;
    settings.format = BaseVideoCapturer.NV21;
    settings.expectedDelay = 0;
    return settings;
}
```

The app calls `startCameraCapture()` to start capturing video from the custom video capturer.

The publisher adds video frames to the published stream.
