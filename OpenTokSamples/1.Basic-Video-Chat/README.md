Starter Template
===================================

This template serves as a starting point for building an Android application using OpenTok.

To get a basic OpenTok video chat application running, check out the [OpenTok Android Basic Video Chat tutorial](https://tokbox.com/developer/tutorials/android/basic-video-chat/step-1/). This app shows how to accomplish basic tasks using the [OpenTok Android SDK](https://tokbox.com/opentok/libraries/client/android/).

If you prefer to start with a completed version of the tutorial, use the project in the Basic Video Chat folder.
