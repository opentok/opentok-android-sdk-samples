# Basic Video Chat Java

This application provides a completed version of the OpenTok [Basic Video Chat tutorial](https://tokbox.com/developer/tutorials/android/) for Android (differing only in some additional validation checks). Upon deploying this sample application, you should be able to have two-way audio and video communication using OpenTok.

Main features:
* Connect to an OpenTok session
* Publish an audio-video stream to the session
* Subscribe to another client's audio-video stream

# Configure the app 
Open the `OpenTokConfig` file and configure the `API_KEY`, `SESSION_ID`, and `TOKEN` variables. You can obtain these values from your [TokBox account](https://tokbox.com/account/#/).

### (Optional) Deploy a back end web service

 For a production application, the `SESSION_ID` and `TOKEN` values must be generated by your app server application and passed to the client, because:
 - credentials would expire after a certain amount of time
 - credentials are lined to given session (all users would be connected to the same room)
 
To quickly deploy a pre-built server click at one of the Heroku buttons below. You'll be sent to Heroku's website and prompted for your OpenTok `API Key` and `API Secret` â€” you can obtain these values on your project page in your [TokBox account](https://tokbox.com/account/user/signup). If you don't have a Heroku account, you'll need to sign up (it's free).

> Note: You can also build your server from scratch using one of the [server SDKs](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/server/).

After deploying the server open the `ServerConfig` file in this project and configure the `CHAT_SERVER_URL` with your domain to fetch credentials from the server:

```java
public static final String CHAT_SERVER_URL = "https://YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com";
```

> Note that this application will ignore credentials in the `OpenTokConfig` file when `CHAT_SERVER_URL` contains a valid URL.

This is the code responsible for retrieving the credentials from web server:

```java
private void getSession() {
    Log.i(TAG, "getSession");

    Call<GetSessionResponse> call = apiService.getSession();

    call.enqueue(new Callback<GetSessionResponse>() {
        @Override
        public void onResponse(Call<GetSessionResponse> call, Response<GetSessionResponse> response) {
            GetSessionResponse body = response.body();
            initializeSession(body.apiKey, body.sessionId, body.token);
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(Call<GetSessionResponse> call, Throwable t) {
            throw new RuntimeException(t.getMessage());
        }
    });
}
```
