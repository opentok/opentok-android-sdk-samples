## Open project

1. Clone this repository `git@githubx.com:opentok/opentok-android-sdk-samples.git`
2. Start [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
3. In the `Quick Start` panel, click `Open an existing Android Studio Project`
4. Navigate to the repository folder, select the desired project subfolder, and click `Choose`

## Set up credentials

You will need a valid [TokBox account](https://tokbox.com/account/user/signup) for most of the sample projects. OpenTok credentials (`API_KEY`, `SESSION_ID`, `TOKEN`) are stored inside `OpenTokConfig` class. For these sample applications, credentials can be retrieved from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/projects) and hardcoded in the application, however for a production environment server should provide these credentials (check [Basic-Video-Chat](/Basic-Video-Chat) project). 

> Note: To facilitate testing connect to the same session using [OpenTok Playground](https://tokbox.com/developer/tools/playground/) (web client).
